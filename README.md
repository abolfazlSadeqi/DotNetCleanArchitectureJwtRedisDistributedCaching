## Elasticsearch 
   is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents

## Serilog 
  is a diagnostic logging library for .NET applications. It is easy to set up, has a clean API, and runs on all recent .NET platforms. While it's useful even in the simplest applications, Serilog's support for structured logging shines when instrumenting complex, distributed, and asynchronous 

### Steps implementation (Logging with elasticsearch )

#### 1.Install NuGet Package(s) into your Project

 |PackageName|Desc|
 |---|----|
|Serilog.AspNetCore|Serilog support for ASP.NET Core logging|
|Serilog.Enrichers.Environment| Enrich Serilog log events with properties from System.Environment.|
|Serilog.Exceptions|Serilog.Exceptions is an add-on to Serilog to log exception details and custom properties that are not output in Exception.ToString()|
|Serilog.Sinks.Debug | A Serilog sink that writes log events to the debug output window|
|Serilog.Sinks.Elasticsearch | Serilog sink for Elasticsearch|

#### 2.Adding Serilog in appsettings.json
```
"Serilog": {
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
       "Microsoft":"Information",
        "System": "Warning"
      }
    } },
```

#### 3.Adding ElasticConfiguration  in appsettings.json
```
"ElasticConfiguration": {
    "Uri": "http://localhost:9200"
  },
```

#### 4.Register Serilog or ELK services in  Program.cs or Startup
         services.AddSerilog();
     LoggerSerilogELK.ConfigureLogging(Configuration); 

#### 5.Add Base Class( you need to add the basic code to the project)

#### 6.Register Example logs in your application

Controller
```
private readonly ILogger<CustomersController> _logger;

    public CustomersController(ILogger<CustomersController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
        _DistributedCache = DistributedCache;
    }
```

Action:
```
_logger.LogInformation("start_Customer");
```

## read or update values into appsetting-json in Web Mvc

Example appsetting-json 
```
"AppSettings": {
 "AppVersion": "1.2",
 "AppId": 0,
 "AppName": ""
 },
```

Example of Settings
```
public class AppSettings
 {
 public string AppVersion { get; set; }
 public string TypeLog { get; set; }
 public string AppName { get; set; }
 }
```

### Steps implementation (read  values into appsetting-json )

#### 1.Add configuration to Startup file or Program file:
```
services.AddOptions();
services.Configure<AppSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));
```

#### 2.You could also use below code to gain access to the settings values
```
private readonly AppSettings _settings;
public HomeController(
 IOptionsSnapshot<AppSettings> settings = null)
{
 if (settings != null) _settings = settings.Value;
}
public IActionResult Index()
{
 var _resul = _settings;
 return View();
}
```
### Steps implementation (update values into appsetting-json )

#### 1.Add configuration to Startup file or Program file (For reload Appsetting After Change)
```
public Startup( Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostingEnvironment env)
 {
 var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
 .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
 .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true)
 .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: false, 
reloadOnChange: true)
 .AddEnvironmentVariables();
 Configuration = builder.Build();
 //Configuration = configuration;
 }
```

#### 2.Add Base Class(you need to add the basic code to the project)
#### 3.Update AppSetting
```
var settingsUpdater = new AppSettingsUpdater();
settingsUpdater.UpdateAppSetting(Key, value);
```
Example:
```
 public IActionResult Index()
 {
 var settingsUpdater = new AppSettingsUpdater();
 settingsUpdater.UpdateAppSetting("AppSettings:AppVersion", "1.7.5.2");
 settingsUpdater.UpdateAppSetting("AppSettings:AppName", "Test");
 settingsUpdater.UpdateAppSetting("AppSettings:AppId", 1014);
 return View();
 }
 ```

## JWT: 
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
## Identity : 
ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system which allows you to add login functionality to your application.used to implement forms authentication

## Defined distributed cache

A distributed cache is a cache shared by multiple app servers, typically maintained as an external service to the app servers that access it. A distributed cache can improve the performance and scalability of an ASP.NET Core app

# Hangfire
   Hangfire is an open-source framework that  An easy way to perform background processing in .NET and .NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate process required.

# BusinessObject in StimulSoft

One of the methods of show reports without direct connection to the database is to use Business object 

This is  a very esay simple application ReportBusinessObject to and .Net7 and StimulSoft For Learn

## Defined BusinessObject in StimulSoft
   A Business object is an object of the data class that can be used to represent data in various structures :tables, lists, arrays, etc.

## Clean Architecture

Install Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template on nuget

I used of this is template Clean Architecture([Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template][1] ),customized based on my own code
